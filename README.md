# 👋 Hey, I’m imabrek

I’m **15 years old**, curious, and always building stuff on the internet 🚀  
Currently vibing with **React.js** and experimenting with ideas that mix code, games, and creativity.

---

## 🧠 What I’m into
- Developing and improving **open-source games**
- Building my own **AI bot using APIs**
- Exploring ideas at the intersection of **tech & creativity**
- Deep interest in **history and geography**

---

## 🎮 Past Project
I previously created an online game called **canvaspixel.fun**.  
It gained traction and generated a **moderate but real income**, before shutting down due to an unfortunate situation.  
Still a big learning W and a core part of my journey.

---

## 🌍 About me
- From **Turkey**
- Of **Nogai and Circassian** descent
- History & geography enjoyer
- **Wolf enjoyer** 🐺 (yes, unironically)
